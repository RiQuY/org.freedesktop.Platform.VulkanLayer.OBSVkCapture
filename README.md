Vulkan Capture for OBS
======================

Tools to capture Vulkan/OpenGL applications with OBS. For instructions on how to use, see [this page](https://github.com/nowrep/obs-vkcapture#usage).

For this to work you also need the corresponding OBS VkCapture plugin for OBS Studio. This plugin is available as [`com.obsproject.Studio.Plugin.OBSVkCapture` on Flathub](https://github.com/flathub/com.obsproject.Studio.Plugin.OBSVkCapture).
